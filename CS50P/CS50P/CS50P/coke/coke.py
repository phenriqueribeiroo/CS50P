# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents
# and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and
# 5 cents.

# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to
# insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the
# amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how
# many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only
# input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted
# denomination.

coin = int(input("Insert Coin: "))
coke = 50
if coin == 5 or coin == 10 or coin == 25:
    amount_due = coke - coin
else:

while amount_due >= 0:
    print(f"Amount Due: {amount_due}")
    coin = int(input("Insert Coin: "))
    if coin == 5 or coin == 10 or coin == 25:
        amount_due = amount_due - coin
    else:
        amount_due = amount_due
    if amount_due == 0:
        break


if amount_due <= 0:
