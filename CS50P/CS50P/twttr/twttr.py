# When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save
# time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally
# called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that
# prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but
# with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in
# uppercase or lowercase.

a = input("Input: ")
vowels = ["A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
print("Output: ", end="")
for i in a:
    if i in vowels:
        print("", end="")
    else:
        print(i, end="")
print()
